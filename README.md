### üß† [The Logic](https://spectacular-tartufo-1e017e.netlify.app)

The Calm Health Platform leverages React as its primary frontend framework, ensuring a responsive and seamless user interface. Firebase is harnessed for secure user authentication, guaranteeing a safe login process, and acts as the database for storing daily survey ratings, facilitating consistent user engagement.

To enhance the user experience, our platform integrates the OpenAI API for personalized feedback on survey scores, providing users with tailored insights and recommendations based on their wellness journey. Additionally, expert perspectives are embedded throughout the platform, offering valuable guidance and support on each page.

Netlify is instrumental in implementing serverless functions and managing environment variables, contributing to the platform's efficiency and dynamism. This amalgamation of technologies aims to deliver a comprehensive and interactive wellness experience, surpassing conventional health platforms by focusing on user engagement and expert-driven insights.

### Built With

* React: At the core of Calm is React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive web applications with its component-based architecture.

* React Router: Calm uses React Router to enable smooth navigation. It provides the ability to create multiple views and routes within a single-page application, enhancing user experience.

* OpenAI API: Calm integrates the OpenAI API to deliver custom feedback. OpenAI's AI models extract key information and create educational feedback and interaction, enhancing the learning experience.

* Netlify: Netlify was used for hosting the website. Furthermore, to hide my API keys I made use of severless function and environment variables, which are both part of netlify's features.

* Additional Libraries: Calm relies on additional libraries and functions to optimize its features. For instance, Firebase is employed for user authentication and Firestore for database management, ensuring secure user interactions and data storage. Various other libraries and functions work together to enhance Mindscribe's overall efficiency and effectiveness.
