      Recommendations: 
      Thank you for checking in today. Great Job on Sleep! Your dedication to Sleep is truly paying off with an average of 4.5. Keep up the fantastic work! ðŸŽ‰ After reviewing your scores, I noticed that Relationships has room for improvement. Remember, we're not aiming for perfection here, just progress. Now, let's focus on boosting Relationships. Andrew Huberman suggests that small, consistent changes make a big impact. Consider incorporating Calling a friend more often into your routine for an extra boost. For instance, Set a reminder every week to call your best friend. Remember, progress over perfection! ðŸš€
      
      Keep shining! âœ¨
